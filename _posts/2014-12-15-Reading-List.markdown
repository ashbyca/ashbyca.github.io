I happen to read a lot.. From comics, deep technical books, politics, to my favorite - thrillers and suspense novels.  Instead of listing my favorite books I have come across, I decided to share some lists that I reference from time to time.

 1. [@Attrc Reading List](http://www.dfir.org/?q=node/8) - Good list of DFIR Books
 2. [SANS Reading List](https://www.sans.edu/cyber-research/book-reviews/article/security-books-best) - General Security Books
 3. [Scott Roberts Reading List](https://medium.com/@sroberts/cti-reading-list-a93ccdd7469c) - Great CTI Books
