In this multi-part post I'm going to share a few techniques I use to automate <i>some</i> of the required analysis of suspecious software.  

This includes navitve tools on OSX with a victim machine (guest os) in VirtualBox.  All analysis is them sent to a Cuckoo
instance for automated analysis.  Please note this includes a single virtual machines and a host computer, however you could
install Cuckoo on a virtual hosts to achieve the same results.

A high-level architecture is below for reference:

<insert architecture>

At a minimum you need to have the following software intalled on your OSX device:

1.  Homebrew + additional system libraries
2.  Xcode + commandline tools
3.  Virtualbox + 1 or 2 guest machines, depending on your architecture
4.  Cuckoo application + dependiences (If not in a virtual machine - optional)
5.  Malware :)

Stay tuned, in part 2 we will discuss preparing your host machine.
