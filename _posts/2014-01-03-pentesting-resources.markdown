In my previous [post](https://ashbyca.github.io/2013/webgoat-lab/), I showed you how using to build a vulnerable web server in a virtual machine to test your hacking skills.  Recently while researching for CTF (Capture the Flag) images I came across a couple of great resources listed below on pre-compiled vulenrable machines to maintain your skills.

For those that need help building a hacking lab, check out this video below.
