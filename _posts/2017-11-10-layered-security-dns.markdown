One the many layers of defense I use on my personal network is [Domain Name System (DNS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System) blocking.
For many years I have relied on [OpenDNS](https://www.opendns.com/), but recently the [Global Cyber Alliance](https://www.globalcyberalliance.org) in collaboration with [IBM](https://ibm.com) and 
[Packet Clearing House](https://www.pch.net/) released a free DNS service that prevents a mariad of malicious activity for free called [Quad9](https://www.quad9.net).

While I'm happy with OpenDNS, I figured it would be a great opportunity to share some links that outline comparisons of various serivcies and explains how easy
it is to install this protection.
