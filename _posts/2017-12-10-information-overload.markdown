One of the disciplines of being a threat intelligence analyst is consuming large amounts of information and in turn taking necessary actions.  This could include media types like, youtube videos, blog posting, physical reports, etc.  You also have the challenge of different platforms adding fuel to the fire.
 
Recently I purchased a subscription to <a href="https://feedly.com">Feedly</a> in an effort to help ease the information overload problem being faced with.  I was already a free user who switched after the Google Reader platform died so the transition was simple.  The paid version has some nice offerings, my favorites being <a href="https://blog.feedly.com/boards/">Boards</a> and <a href="https://blog.feedly.com/launching-shared-collections">Shared Collections</a>.

If your interested, below are my latest OPML export as well as my shared collection to get you started quickly!

While this hasnâ€™t solved all my issues re: information overload it has be a welcome addition.  I will update this post with relevant information as more habits mature.  You can also review this post from <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/smart-threat-intelligence-analysts/">RecordedFuture titled: 7 Habits of Smart Threat Intelligence Analysts</a> for additional information on the topic.
