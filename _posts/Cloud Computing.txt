As of late, I’ve been playing around with the various cloud instances being offered by [Microsoft](https://azure.microsoft.com/), [Amazon](https://aws.amazon.com/), and [Google](https://cloud.google.com/) in an effort to take my daily compute to the clouds and ditch a traditional laptop/desktop and for either a Chromebook or iPad as my daily driver.  

My use case for technology is a healthy blend of executive, engineering, and analysts. I’m not in the trenches much these days, instead I’m attending meetings and could be considered an Office power user :( I have a very curious mind, like most in this field, so it scares me “not owning” a general PC in the event I needed to lend the team a hand or investigate something of interest. After much research, I’ve decide to move to [GCP](https://cloud.google.com/) and built a virtual machine with all the command-line utilities needed for performing various analysis and research tasks, while allowing me to continue engineering.  I chose Google, only becuase the provided me with a $300.00 credit for 1yr which honestly is awesome and allows me to get my feet wet without any out of pocket cost.

If you interested in reviewing the tools I have installed, how the different cloud providers stack up please check out the references below.
