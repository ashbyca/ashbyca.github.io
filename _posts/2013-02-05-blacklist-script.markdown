Below is a link to a quick script I created to quickly idenify if a public routable IP address was listed on any blacklists.  The script is easy to use and only takes a single IP address as an argument.


You can download the script [here](https://www.icloud.com/iclouddrive/0PlszoJmGz9k_uNlHWddvavzA#blcheck.sh).
