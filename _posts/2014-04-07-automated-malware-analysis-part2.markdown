If you have been following along from [Part 1](https://ashbyca.github.io/2016/automated-malware-analysis-part1/), we discussed
a general overview of what we are going to accomplish.  Here in Part 2 we will discuss how to setup host machine which is a
Mac OSX device.

Install Required Software and Dependencies

1. Download and install [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org)
2. Download and install [XCode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/)
     * This may require a free Apple Developer account
3. Install XCode command-line tools

```Bash
$ xcode-select --install
```

4. Download and install Homebrew

```Bash
ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/go/install)”
```
5. Once you have Homebrew installed, let's add all the dependiencies.  Type the following commands in your orginal terminal
windows:

```Bash
$ brew install libtool
$ brew install pycrypto
$ brew install pil
$ brew install openpyxl
$ brew install ocaml
$ brew install wget
$ brew install subversion
$ brew install libtool

```

6. Install [distorm3](https://code.google.com/p/distorm/)
    * Download the latest version

```Bash
$ unzip distorm3-1.0.zip
$ cd distorm3-1.0
$ python setup.py build
$ python setup.py build install
```

7. Install [Yara](http://plusvic.github.io/yara/)
     * Download the latest version

```Bash
# ./bootstrap.sh
# ./configure —enable-cuckoo
```

At this point you should have all the applications and dependiencies installed in your OSX device.  Next we will discuss
creating the guest operating systems in [Part 3](https://ashbyca.github.io/2016/automated-malware-analysis-part3/).
