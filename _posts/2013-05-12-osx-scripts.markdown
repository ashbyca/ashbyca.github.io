Lately I have been playing around with Apple Script Editor to automate some tasks on my OSX device.  Descriptions and links are below if you find these useful or want to test:

1. [Disable OSX Dashboard](https://www.icloud.com/iclouddrive/0jdeAQoMJQ7fZiAPDcMOCcuuQ#Disable_OSX_Dashboard.zip)
2. [Remove INET Downloads](https://www.icloud.com/iclouddrive/0xUrrbovJnPg7ScccktIOq2eA#Remove_INET_Downloads.zip)

* To install, download each zip file above, extract the contents and copy to '''~/Library/Scripts'''.
* Make sure to activate the menu option in Script Editor Preferences if you haven't already.
* All scripts currently work with OSX v10.10 and below.  

To execute the script, click the little scroll on the menu and select the one you want.  Each script is does what it’s named for, should be self explanatory.  I found this [tutorial](https://macosxautomation.com/applescript/firsttutorial/02.html) for those who haven’t used this software before and want additional information on getting started.
