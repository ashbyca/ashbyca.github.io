One of the disciplines of being a threat intelligence analyst is consuming large amounts of information and in turn taking necessary actions.  This could include media types like, youtube videos, blog posting, physical reports, etc.  You also have the challenge of different platforms adding fuel to the fire.
 
Recently I purchased a subscription to [Feedly https://feedly.com] to help ease the information overload coming my way.  I was already a free user who switched after the Google Reader platform was decommissioned so the transition was simple.  The paid version has some nice offerings, one of my favorite has been [Boards https://blog.feedly.com/boards/] and [Shared Collections https://blog.feedly.com/launching-shared-collections/].

If your interested, below are my latest OPML export as well as my shared collection.

While this hasn’t solved all my issues re: information overload it has be a welcome addition.  I will update this post with relevant information as more habits mature.  You can also review this post from [RecordedFuture titled: 7 Habits of Smart Threat Intelligence Analysts https://www.recordedfuture.com/smart-threat-intelligence-analysts/] for additional information.
