After preparing most of our configurations for the OSX system in [Part 2](https://ashbyca.github.io/2016/automated-malware-analysis-part2/) of the multi-part post on "Automated Malware Analyis" we are finally
ready to install our Cuckoo instance.  This can be accomplished on either the existing host device (OSX) or in a virtual
machine.  For my setup, I have a cuckoo instance running on my host machine along with the required software, the commands
below is how I achieved this.

Install Python + dependencies - Installed where you have Cuckoo.  Most of these can be installed with either pip or easy_install.

python-magic 

```Bash
$ easy_install python-magic
```
python-dpkt

```Bash
$ pip install dpkt
```

python-sqlalchemy 

```Bash
$ easy_install sqlalchemy
```

python-mako 

```Bash
$ easy_install mako
```

python-jinja

```Bash
$ easy_install Jinja2
```

python-bottle

```Bash
$ easy_install Bottle
```

[SSDeep](https://github.com/ssdeep-project/ssdeep/releases) - for calculating hashes

python-pyrex

```Bash
$ easy_install pyrex
```

pyssdeep 

```Bash
$ svn checkout http://pyssdeep.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ pyssdeep
```

[MondoDB](http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-os-x/) and Python Support

```Bash
$ easy_install pymongo
$ curl http://downloads.mongodb.org/osx/mongodb-osx-x86_64-2.4.5.tgz > mongodb.tgz
```

pcregrep 

```Bash
$ brew install pcre
```

yara and yara-python

```Bash
$ brew install yara && brew install yara python
```

libpcap 

```Bash
$ brew install libpcap
```

Download & Install [Cuckoo](https://cuckoosandbox.org)

A couple of notes after the install
1. change permissions for cuckoo
2. change permissions of tcpdump

```Bash
first create backup cp tcpdump tcpdump.org
$ sudo chmod +s /usr/sbin/tcpdump
```

 At this point you should have cuckoo installed with all the required dependiences.  Next up creating our victim machine.
