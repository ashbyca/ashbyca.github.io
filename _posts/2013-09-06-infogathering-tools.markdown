Today, I’m going to share a few "Information Gathering" resources I use as my daily driver to obtain specific data on various subjects.  This could include domain information, pDNS, whois, category of services, owner, etc.  As always this isn’t a conclusive list and may others exists in this space.  All of these tools run natively on OSX with  Homebrew and the necessary dependencies.
