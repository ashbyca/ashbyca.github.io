For the longest time, I have stuggled to find a great OSX and iOS email application that allowed for seamless secure email interoperability.
Well the search is over as today I discovered Canary Mail.  Immedietly I downloaded both the iOS and OSX applications, loaded up my PGP key 
and starting sending encrypted email. Over the next few months, I'm going to use this as my daily email driver and will post a full review, 
until then if your looking for a similiar solution, this might be it.
