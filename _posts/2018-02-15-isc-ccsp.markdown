Yesterday, after about 2months of studying I sat and passed the the [ISC CCSP](https://www.isc2.org/Certifications/CCSP) exam.  This is a relatively new exam by ISC on Cloud Security.  The exam itself was a lot easier then when I achieved the [CISSP](https://www.isc2.org/Certifications/CISSP) certification in 2007.

I can't go into specfics of the exam or content but I can share my [study notes](https://ashby.keybase.pub/Blog/CCSP%20Study%20Notes.txt) and other [relevant docs](https://ashby.keybase.pub/Blog/CCSP%20Material.zip) for others.

Good Luck!
