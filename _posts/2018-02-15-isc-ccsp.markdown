Yesterday, after about 2months of studying I sat and passed my first cloud exam, the Certified Cloud Security Professional [ISC CCSP](https://www.isc2.org/Certifications/CCSP) exam.  This is a relatively new exam by ISC on Cloud Security.  The exam itself was a lot easier then when I achieved the [CISSP](https://www.isc2.org/Certifications/CISSP) certification in 2007.

I used the following resources and approach:
* Attended a 5day virtual training class from [Global Knowledge](https://www.globalknowledge.com/us-en/course/91202/ccsp-certification-prep-course/)
* Read the Official [ISC Study Book](https://www.amazon.com/Official-ISC-Guide-CCSP-CBK/dp/1119276721)
* Read the O'Hara [Study Guide](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1119277418/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o02_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1)
* Practice questions with this [iOS app from ISC](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/ccsp-study-isc-official-app/id1247187538?mt=8)

While I can't elaborate on specfics of the exam or content I will share my [study notes](https://ashby.keybase.pub/Blog/CCSP-Study-Notes.pdf) and other [relevant docs](https://ashby.keybase.pub/Blog/CCSP%20Material.zip) for others if they are interested.

Good Luck!
