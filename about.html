<h3>Bio</h3>
<p>
Christopher Ashby, a cyber security veteran has more than 20 years of proven experience participating in a broad range of corporate initiatives 
including architecting, implementing, and supporting information-security solutions in direct support of business objectives.  He has held multiple
positions from analyst to executive.
<p>
In his most current role he focuses on reducing operational cost and business risk by actively identifying and preventing cyberattacks against people, 
process, and technology for large organizations and governments entities.  

Prior to this position, he served as a senior director of security at CBS Corporation where he assembled a best-in-class global security program that was aligned to the NIST Cybersecurity Framework. One of his many responsibilities during this time 
was creating a threat intelligence program that was integrated into every division and the organizations various lines of businesses. These included but not limited 
to Privacy, M&A, Physical Security, Content Security, and Live Events. Finally, he also chartered the Media and Information Sharing Forum (MediaISSF) along with others, 
which was a closed group of vertical partners across media and entertainment that shared threat intelligence (much like an ISAC) on a routine basis.
